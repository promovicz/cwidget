//  Manages color allocation so as to allow any combination of
//  foreground/background colors to be used.  If there aren't enough
//  color pairs available to handle all color combinations, this will
//  act as though no colors are available.  NOTE: colors whose
//  foreground and background are the same will be reduced to an
//  arbitrary color of that background; it is expected that the caller
//  will apply A_INVIS to such colors.  This is done to conserve color
//  pairs so as to allow the use of the 'default' color.
