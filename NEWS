[0.5.6.1]

  * Actually distribute the ikiwiki input files in "make dist".

[0.5.6]

  * ABI change: the SONAME is now libcwidget.so.1.

  * Add general documentation and information.  This is the cwidget
    Web site, compiled as a local collection of HTML files by IkiWiki.

  * If stdin is closed, throw a fatal exception from the main loop
    instead of spinning forever. (Debian bug #451770)

  * Import some cppunit tests that apply to cwidget.

  * Add a missing #include <stdarg.h> in ssprintf.cc. (Debian bug #452979)

  * Add untested support for the mouse wheel if ncurses is compiled
    with support for mouse button 5.

[0.5.5]

  * Fix several include paths that were relative to the source
    directory, not relative to cwidget.

[0.5.4]

  * Fix the include path declared by the .pc file; it should point at
    "includedir", not "pkgincludedir".

[0.5.3]

  * Generate a cwidget-config.h file that contains #defines needed for
    the public interface of cwidget to make sense.

  * Build a .pc file so that pkg-config can be used to set up
    compile/link flags for cwidget-using packages.

  * Add an entry point that returns the current library version.

  * Remove more references to vscreen.

  * Remove some references to libapt.

[0.5.2]

  * Fix documentation building again: we need the sub-makefile to get
    cleaning to happen nicely, but the main makefile needs to know
    about it, so don't build docs in doc/ on "make all".

[0.5.1]

  * Actually install headers in "make install".

  * Fix documentation building to be more friendly to the Debian packaging.

[0.5.0]

  * Initial release.

  * Changes from aptitude:

    + Rename vscreen to cwidget. (the name "vscreen" had to do with a
      very very old version of the library and is no longer relevant)

    + Move everything into C++ namespaces under cwidget.

    + Reorganize the code to move more generic code into the generic
      directory.
