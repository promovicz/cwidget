### OS-specific instructions

This section describes how to acquire the prerequisites of cwidget on

If your operating system is not listed here, please email
<alioth-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org> with instructions on how to
install the prerequisites on your operating system.

#### Debian unstable

  * On Debian unstable, install the packages `libsigc++-2.0-dev`,

## Compiling cwidget
<a name="compiling">

To compile cwidget, run the following command in the root of the
source distribution:

>     sh ./configure && make

This will autodetect libraries and utilities on your system, then
compile the source code.  By default, cwidget will be configured to be
installed in the directory `/usr/local/`; to place it in another
directory, run

>     sh ./configure --prefix=$PREFIX && make

where `$PREFIX` is the directory under which cwidget should be
installed.  For instance, to install in your home directory, you could
pass `--prefix=$HOME` on the command-line.

If you also want to build documentation, run:

>     make doc

after building the source.

## Installing cwidget

Once you have [[compiled|install#compiling]] cwidget, you can install
it with the command:

>     make install

If you are installing in a system directory, this command has to be
run as root.

Once cwidget is installed, you may want to [[use|using]] it in some of
your own programs.
