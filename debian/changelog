cwidget (0.5.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  
  * Rename libcwidget0 and libcwidget0-dbg to libcwidget1 and
    libcwidget1-dbg.
  
  * Declare libcwidget-doc to be in section doc, to make lintian happy.
  
  * No longer conflict/provide/replace libcwidget-dbg; those relationships
    were added because libcwidget0-dbg fully replaced libcwidget-dbg, but
    libcwidget1-dbg is not related to libcwidget-dbg.

cwidget (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  * ABI change; the SONAME is now libcwidget.so.1.

  * If stdin is closed, abort the main loop with an exception instead
    of spinning forever. (Closes: #451770)

  * Add a missing #include <stdarg.h>; fixes building on stable and on
    some other platforms. (Closes: #452979)
  
  * Add a build dependency on cppunit so 'make check' does something
    useful.
  
  * Add a build dependency on ikiwiki so we can build all the
    documentation.

cwidget (0.5.5-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix a related but different bug in Makefile.am. (Closes: #451400)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Nov 2007 21:35:51 -0800

cwidget (0.5.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Actually fix Makefile.in. (Closes: #451400)
  
  * Add Homepage and VCS-* fields to the control file.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Nov 2007 08:21:57 -0800

cwidget (0.5.5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do a quick fix for a Makefile bug (a better fix is already present in
    the upstream repository). (Closes: #451400)
  
  * Rename the debug package from libcwidget-dbg to libcwidget0-dbg, since
    obviously once the soname changes we'll need a separate debug package.
