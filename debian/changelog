cwidget (0.5.17-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changes to build with GCC-5 and in C++11 mode (Closes: #792681).
    Thanks Matthias Klose.  Prompted by:
    - transition to GCC-5 as default compiler in Debian unstable;
    - failure to compile cwidget without -std=c++11 with
      this new version;
    - there is a change in the ABI of libstdc++ w.r.t. GCC < 5, in
      std::string, std::list and other parts (sigc++-2.0 is a dependency of
      cwidget and uses std::list in the API)
  * Quell lintian warning xs-testsuite-header-in-debian-control by
    removing XS- prefix in debian/control
  * Revamp options passed to the compiler, among others some obsolete
    compiler flags that tried to address a problem with old versions of
    the compiler, but that were actually not enabled since long ago
  * Do not install jquery.js and link it from documentation directories in
    another place where it cropped up
  * Update Build-Depends-Indep on perlmagick to libimage-magick-perl
    (Closes: #789224).  Thanks Martin Michlmayr.

  * Add a patch to have Doxygen not write timestamps in the generated
    documentation to allow package builds to be reproducible.  (Closes:
    #762666)

  [ Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo ]

cwidget (0.5.17-1) unstable; urgency=medium

cwidget (0.5.16-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes needed)
  * Use dh-autoreconf instead of autotools-dev for better new-port
    coverage.  Thanks Colin Watson for the report and the patch (I applied
    it by hand and slightly modified since it didn't apply cleanly).
    (Closes: #732539)
  * Quell lintian warnings:
    - embedded-javascript-library: add Depends on libjs-jquery in the -doc
      package, and create a symbolic link instead of install the local copy
      of the file "jquery.min.js"
    - "binary-control-field-duplicates-source": remove duplicate Priority
      field from most of the binary packages
    - missing-debian-source-format: add "1.0" to "debian/source/format"
      for the time being
    - vcs-field-not-canonical
    - no-upstream-changelog: upstream's NEWS is the changelog
  * In -doc package, downgrade browser from Recommends to Suggests
  * VCS changed from 'cwidget/debian/.git' to 'cwidget/cwidget.git'

cwidget (0.5.16-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable strict aliasing to prevent g++ from erroring out in the build.
    "Fixing" it this way is a horrible hack, but the error message is
    entirely incomprehensible, I can't figure out which code, if any, is
    at fault here, and my attempts to fix it by phrasing the code
    differently have failed. (Closes: #561157, #526674)

  * Add misc:Depends entries on the Depends lines.

cwidget (0.5.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Eliminate the last few missing #includes (in the test cases,
    Closes: #461682)

    Note that in order to build or use cwidget with g++-4.3, you will need a
    version of libsigc++ that supports g++-4.3 (>= 2.0.18-1).

  * Put the documentation in Programming/C++, not the nonexistant
    section Apps/Programming.

  * Fix several threading errors in handling input, particularly when
    cwidget was temporarily suspended and then resumed.
  
    (Closes: #461342) and possibly more, but I'll have to ask the
    reporters.
  
  * If a byte sequence read from stdin can't be decoded in the current
    locale, beep at the user instead of throwing a fatal
    exception. (Closes: #460722)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2008 10:26:00 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Michael Daenzer to support building with
    dpkg-buildpackage -j (Closes: #456678).
  
  * ikiwiki now depends only on what the core engine needs, and so some of
    the plugins that cwidget users are no longer available in a build
    environment without explicitly installing them.

    Add libhtml-scrubber-perl to Build-Depends (Closes: #458654).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Jan 2008 08:58:49 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename debian/libcwidget0.install to debian/libcwidget1.install so the

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Dec 2007 22:24:48 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename libcwidget0 and libcwidget0-dbg to libcwidget1 and
    libcwidget1-dbg.
  
  * Declare libcwidget-doc to be in section doc, to make lintian happy.
  
  * No longer conflict/provide/replace libcwidget-dbg; those relationships
    were added because libcwidget0-dbg fully replaced libcwidget-dbg, but
    libcwidget1-dbg is not related to libcwidget-dbg.

cwidget (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  * ABI change; the SONAME is now libcwidget.so.1.

  * If stdin is closed, abort the main loop with an exception instead
    of spinning forever. (Closes: #451770)

  * Add a missing #include <stdarg.h>; fixes building on stable and on
    some other platforms. (Closes: #452979)
  
  * Add a build dependency on cppunit so 'make check' does something
    useful.
  
  * Add a build dependency on ikiwiki so we can build all the
    documentation.

  * Do a quick fix for a Makefile bug (a better fix is already present in
    the upstream repository). (Closes: #451400)
  
  * Rename the debug package from libcwidget-dbg to libcwidget0-dbg, since
    obviously once the soname changes we'll need a separate debug package.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2007 21:08:10 -0800

cwidget (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low
