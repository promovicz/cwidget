  * Fix several threading errors in handling input, particularly when
    cwidget was temporarily suspended and then resumed.
  
    (Closes: #461342) and possibly more, but I'll have to ask the
    reporters.
  
  * If a byte sequence read from stdin can't be decoded in the current
    locale, beep at the user instead of throwing a fatal
    exception. (Closes: #460722)

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Jan 2008 10:26:00 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch from Michael Daenzer to support building with
    dpkg-buildpackage -j (Closes: #456678).
  
  * ikiwiki now depends only on what the core engine needs, and so some of
    the plugins that cwidget users are no longer available in a build
    environment without explicitly installing them.

    Add libhtml-scrubber-perl to Build-Depends (Closes: #458654).

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Jan 2008 08:58:49 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename debian/libcwidget0.install to debian/libcwidget1.install so the
    library actually gets installed.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Dec 2007 22:24:48 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  
  * Rename libcwidget0 and libcwidget0-dbg to libcwidget1 and
    libcwidget1-dbg.
  
  * Declare libcwidget-doc to be in section doc, to make lintian happy.
  
  * No longer conflict/provide/replace libcwidget-dbg; those relationships
    were added because libcwidget0-dbg fully replaced libcwidget-dbg, but
    libcwidget1-dbg is not related to libcwidget-dbg.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Sat, 15 Dec 2007 18:46:50 -0800

cwidget (0.5.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  * ABI change; the SONAME is now libcwidget.so.1.

  * If stdin is closed, abort the main loop with an exception instead
    of spinning forever. (Closes: #451770)

  * Add a missing #include <stdarg.h>; fixes building on stable and on
    some other platforms. (Closes: #452979)
  
  * Add a build dependency on cppunit so 'make check' does something
    useful.
  
  * Add a build dependency on ikiwiki so we can build all the
    documentation.

  * Do a quick fix for a Makefile bug (a better fix is already present in
    the upstream repository). (Closes: #451400)
  
  * Rename the debug package from libcwidget-dbg to libcwidget0-dbg, since
    obviously once the soname changes we'll need a separate debug package.

 -- Daniel Burrows <dburrows@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Nov 2007 21:08:10 -0800

cwidget (0.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low
